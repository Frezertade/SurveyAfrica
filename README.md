Survey Africa

One of the most challenging problems in African leadership today is the lack of dependable 
and accurate statistics upon which to base policy decisions. Individuals in a community can have greatly varying 
life experiences while living under the same general conditions. It is therefore not sufficient to have anecdotal 
evidence by our politicians or policymakers as the basis of nation wide policy decisions. Such decisions must instead 
be based on scientifically collected data that is representative of the collective experience of the populus. Furthermore,
the data must be evaluated as often enough as is necessary to evaluate the outcomes of such policies. It is extremely 
important to measure the vital statistics of a population. One cannot solve a problem that they cannot measure. 
Survey Africa is an infrastructure project initiative to use technology to collect representative data directly from the people.
